      <p><img src="resources/binary.jpg" align="right" title="The power of the world lies in the hands of two numbers...">Computers run using bits, which are digital devices that have two states: off and on. We represent these two states using 0 for off and 1 for on. As such, it is more efficient to work with 0's and 1's so the computer can run quicker, without having to translate everything to 0's and 1's.</p>
      <p>In order to optimize efficiency, we can represent every number using 0's and 1's. Just like our numbers consist of numbers between 0 and 9, differentiated only by their position in the number, the binary system ("bi-" meaning two) consists of only 0 and 1, differentiated by their position in the number. In our decimal system ("deci" meaning ten), we can break apart numbers like so:</p>

      <p class="example">1396 = (1 * 1000) + (3 * 100) + (9 * 10) + (6 * 1)</p>

      <p>Note that 1 is in the 3<sup>rd</sup> digit from the right (starting the counting from 0), and it is multiplied by 10<sup>3</sup>. Likewise, 3 is the 2<sup>nd</sup> digit, multiplied by 10<sup>2</sup>; 9 is the 1<sup>st</sup> digit, multiplied by 10<sup>1</sup>; 6 is the 0<sup>th</sup> digit, multiplied by 10<sup>0</sup>.</p>
      <p>Binary is similar to this, except it's based off of powers of two, instead of ten. We can also break apart binary numbers:</p>

      <p class="example">1110<sub>2</sub> = (1 * 8) + (1 * 4) + (1 * 2) + (0 * 1) = 14 <sub>10</sub></p>

      <p>The little 2 at the bottom means it's a binary number, and the little 10 means it's a normal decimal number. As you can see, we translated the binary number, 1110, to a normal number, 14. The method is the same: the first 1 is in the 3<sup>rd</sup> digit from the right (starting at 0), so it gets multiplied by 2<sup>3</sup>. The second 1 is in the 2<sup>nd</sup> digit from the right, so it gets multiplied by 2<sup>2</sup>, and so on.</p>
